# JakeBates.com

A constantly maintained personal website that serves as a directory of my resume, personal projects, as well as other relevant documents. Previously this website was hosted via Github Pages with a custom layout I created, using Jekyll as a templating engine. It is now written in React using Google Firebase as a backend.
